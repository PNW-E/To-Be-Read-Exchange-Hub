This directory contains archived legacy setup/start scripts retained for historical reference.

They have been superseded by `scripts/bootstrap.sh` which provides a unified, flag-driven first-time setup and startup experience.

Legacy scripts:
 - setup.sh
 - quickstart.sh
 - smart-start.sh

Recommended: Remove this directory after one release cycle if no issues arise.
