# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Standards

This project implements enterprise-grade security practices:

- **OWASP Top 10 Protection**: Helmet security headers, input sanitization, parameterized queries
- **Authentication & Authorization**: API key auth, role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits on all API endpoints
- **Data Protection**: PostgreSQL parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated npm audit and Dependabot monitoring
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, referrer policy
- **Input Validation**: express-validator on all user inputs
- **Secure Defaults**: Production-ready configuration out of the box

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### For Critical Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue. Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@example.com` (replace with actual contact)
2. **Subject**: Include "[SECURITY]" and a brief description
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Affected versions
   - Your contact information (optional, for acknowledgment)

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide a detailed response within **5 business days** with next steps.

### For Non-Critical Issues

For lower-severity issues (configuration recommendations, non-exploitable edge cases):

1. Open a GitHub issue using the Security Vulnerability template
2. Mark it as "security" label
3. Provide as much detail as possible without sharing exploitation details publicly

## Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Initial acknowledgment | 48 hours |
| Severity assessment | 5 business days |
| Fix development (Critical) | 7 days |
| Fix development (High) | 14 days |
| Fix development (Medium/Low) | 30 days |
| Public disclosure | After fix is deployed + 7 days |

## Security Update Process

1. **Triage**: Security team assesses severity using CVSS scoring
2. **Development**: Fix is developed in a private branch
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing including security regression tests
4. **Deployment**: Patch released as soon as possible
5. **Notification**: Security advisory published with CVE (if applicable)
6. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure with reporter (if applicable)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Production Deployment

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files; use secrets management
- **Database**: Use strong passwords (20+ characters), enable SSL/TLS connections
- **API Keys**: Rotate API keys regularly; use different keys per environment
- **Rate Limits**: Tune rate limits based on your traffic patterns
- **Monitoring**: Enable Prometheus metrics and log aggregation
- **Updates**: Subscribe to releases to get notified of security patches
- **Network**: Deploy behind reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with HTTPS
- **Backups**: Regular encrypted backups of PostgreSQL database

### Configuration Checklist

```bash
# Required environment variables for production
NODE_ENV=production
DB_PASSWORD=<strong-random-password>
API_KEY_ENABLED=true
API_KEY=<rotate-regularly>

# Recommended hardening
API_RATE_MAX=50                    # Tune based on usage
SYNC_RATE_MAX=5                    # Prevent abuse
LOG_LEVEL=warn                     # Reduce info leakage
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **JWT Expiration**: Currently using API keys; JWT implementation planned for v2.0
2. **Audit Logging**: Basic logging present; enhanced audit trail planned
3. **MFA**: Multi-factor authentication not yet implemented
4. **Encryption at Rest**: Database encryption depends on PostgreSQL configuration

### Planned Enhancements

- [ ] JWT with refresh tokens and expiration
- [ ] Enhanced audit logging with tamper-proof storage
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (TOTP)
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration examples
